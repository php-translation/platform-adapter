# Platform adapters

This repository contains platform adapters for a commonly used translation platform. 

## Are your adapter missing?

If you want to add a new adapter you may just create a subfolder to `src/`. All those
subfolders will be a separate package. 

Notice that we are using a `travis.ini` file instead of `travis.yml`. The ini file will
contain a list of supported PHP versions.
